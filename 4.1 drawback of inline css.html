    <h1>drawback of inline css and advantage of internal css</h1>
    <h2>let's suppose i've thousands of lines of code here and i need the same 
        font color and background color for each so for that if i'm using inline css 
        then i need to mention the style tag in each line which is lot of time consuming
        waste so in order to solve this problem we'll be using the internal css for that 
        let's see an example of 10 line of code of same font and background color with 
        inline css and internal css .
    </h2>
