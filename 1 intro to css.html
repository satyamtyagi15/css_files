        in the same line but anywhere on the same html page : let's see an example  </h2>
       <h2><p>for the internal css we need to use the style tag now which would be wrapped 
           inside the head tag in the style tag you need to mention that you want to style 
           your paragraph and then in the opening and closing curly braces mention the font 
           color and the background color for example i want the font color of this paragraph
           to be red and background color to be green.</p></h2>
