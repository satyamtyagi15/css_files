    <h1>Advantage of external css over internal </h1>
    <h2>now suppose we need to link more than 1 and different 
        html file or want the same font color and and the 
        background color in more than 1 html file then this could 
        done using external css easily rather than performing it with 
        internal css as by internal css we need to copy paste the same 
        code in the head tag of every html files but  by using the external css
        it can be done easily as we just need to link one css file with multiple html file 
         let's see how, suppose we have 2 html file 5.2 and 5.3
        and i need the same color and the same background in these two different html file
