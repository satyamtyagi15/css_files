    <h2> Let's suppose we're using all the three type of css 
        in the same html file then which would you think has the 
        priority <br>
        case 1 : priority b\w internal external and inline all three 
        then the inline will have the highest priority among all three 
        case 2 : priority b\w internal and external css 
        so here it depends which code is written at last in the head tag 
        will have the highest priority because html performs line by line execution
