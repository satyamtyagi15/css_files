    <h2>psuedo class </h2>
    <h3>psuedo classes : they are mainly used to style elment/tag based on their state <br><br>
    let's take the example of button tag :
<br><br> button states : <br>
    <ol><li>hover (universal state): positioning your cursor or pointing your pointer cursor on
         the button tag or element</li>
    <li>active state : when i just go and click on the particular tag it's active state </li>
    <li>focus state : left keying a particular button is called as focus state. it's used to
         indicate that we've already visited the button by clicking  </li>
    <br> let's see the example with the button tag 
    </ol></h3>
    <br><br>
    <button>HEY CLICK ON ME SIR/MA'AM </button>
