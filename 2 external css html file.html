    <h1>External css </h1>
    <h2>External css : having the seperate or different .css file and linking it with 
     a current html file. 
    </h2>
    <h2><p>Now for the external css let's suppose i need the font color as aqua and the 
     background color as black of this paragraph by using external css so for that i first 
     need to create an external .css file and then there we would be using  paragraph tag p and 
     in the curly braces mention the font color and the background color of this paragraph 
     <br> now 2nd part is the linking part how we would link our enternal .css file to this 
     current html file for that we'll be using link tag wrapped inside head tag in the current 
     html file . <br>now in  the link tag u r able to see 2 different options that are rel and href <br>
     rel: relationship <br>
     href : hyper reference
     <br>In rel u need to mention that you're linking the stylesheet to this current html file and in the 
     href section provide  the address for that external .css file <br>
     note - don't forget to close the link tag and make it as self closing tag .
    </p></h2>
